                Marcia was born June 9, 1941 and was 84 years old. As a loving Mother and Grandmother, Marcia touched and influenced so many lives.  She was a member of Union Baptist Church for 60 plus years.  She was also a foster parent for several years and cared for several children through that service.  
            </p>
            <p>
                She was proceeded in death by her parents Odell and Ansley Chism, brothers Carl and Garland Chism, sister Hilda, and nephews Joseph Brown and Travis Chism.  She is survived by her husband of 65 years, Jackie Wayne Thompson, daughters Tanya Hildebrand and husband Chuck and Monica Gasaway, sons Marc, Jackie Lynn and Karen, Cleve, and Casey.  She also leaves behind grandchildren:  Samuel, Megan and Hunter, Caleb and wife Kaylee, Brooks and wife Brandy, Jacklyn and DJ, Dakota and husband Collin, Jacob, Kayla and husband Tristan, Zaharrah, Kingston, and Princeton.  Others who will cherish her memory are numerous great grandchildren and a host of beloved friends.

            <p>
                The family would like to especially thank the staff of The Woodlands in Leesville, Louisiana for their concern and loving care of our Mom.  God bless you all!
            </p>
            <p>
                Flowers in remembrance of Mom are appreciated, but in lieu of flowers the family would also request that donations be made to the BEAMS Ministry to supply Bibles to missionaries on their field of service.
